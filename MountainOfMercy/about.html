    <p class="Paragraph">Mountain of Mercy is a UK based charity providing international aid to several countries world wide. The charity provides support to victims of natural disasters and those that are living below the poverty line in the most vulnerable positions. Our Mission is helping to make a difference in alleviating worldwide poverty, suffering and distress by means of volunteer contribution.
<br>
<br>
Striving to go above and beyond our slogan ‘Helping to make a difference’, we have had ran numerous projects across the globe. From our recent project of providing food to the needy in Bangladesh during the 2020 Coronavirus crisis, to building homes and water wells across Sri Lanka, we aim to provide help both for today and tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
Since the establishment of Mountain Of mercy in 2005 the charities main objective and focus has been primarily in Sri Lanka since the Tsunami of 2004.
<br>
<br>
Some of the projects in various countries include:
Sri Lanka – Fishing boats, homes, waterwells, medical clinic, house maintenance,orphanage centres
Bangladesh – Handing out over 50 rikshaws to the poor who’d otherwise pay a large rent out of their measly wage.
Rohingya camps – Having visited the camps Mountain Of Mercy carried out a housing project which sheltered 100 families.
